        <br />
        <p class="fw-bold fs-1">Motivation</p>
        <p class="px-5">As we see more and more each year, the effects of climate change are becoming more notorious on
            our planet.
            Increased temperatures and changing rain patterns coupled with the effects of years of irresponsible land
            use are contributing to the erosion and desertification of productive land. It is estimated that global
            drylands could expand by as much as 23 % by the end of the 21st century and that as much as 80 % of this
            will occur in developing countries *<a href="https://wad.jrc.ec.europa.eu/aridityprojections"
                target="_blank">(1)</a>. The loss of production this brings is hard to quantify but it is clear that
            it will stretch the remaining resources even thinner.</p>
        <p class="px-5">A reduction in exploitable arable land does not only signify a future scarcity of resources but
            also a
            decrease in revenue for farmers and, consequently, an expansion of the rural exodus phenomenon, posing a
            threat to the sustainability of rural life. *<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.01.014"
                target="_blank">(2)</a>. It is imperative that rural communities are given all means possible to
            maintain their lifestyle, which provides food to people and animals. While governmental aid is a significant
            motivator for farming, it is not enough to keep farmers content. The approach some political entities have
            taken include creating job opportunities for the young, especially women; offering tax benefits; supporting
            entrepreneurship; modernising agricultural industry or protecting hunting.</p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-1">Our solution</p>
        <p class="px-5">Our proposal is based around the idea of democratizing access to new technology in order to
            lower its barrier of entry. We believe that agrivoltaic systems, the cultivation of plants that can grow
            under solar panels, can offer a significant increase in land value and productivity, since land is not
            desertified to produce electricity and crops are offered a shade from the growingly adverse conditions. It
            has been shown that this system can increase land productivity by over 50% *<a
                href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120207" target="_blank">(3)</a> while saving significantly
            more water than traditional methods *<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/land12051069" target="_blank">(4)</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="px-5">What we offer our users, operators of medium and large agricultural landscapes and national
            authorities, is a service in which we do an analysis to evaluate the viability of installing photovoltaic
            panels and growing vegetables. Along with a recommendation on which panels and which plants are best for the
            area depending on factors measured with satellites. We also recommend which plants can be grown in existing
            solar panel parks and we do a follow-up service recommending the necessary changes in cultivation to
            increase soil diversity and long-term yield.</p>
